## Motivation
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that affects people's behavior.
People with ADHD can seem restless, may have trouble concentrating and may act on
impulse. ADHD is classically seen as a childhood disease, although it persists in one out of
two cases in adults. The diagnosis is based on a long and multidisciplinary process, involving
different health professionals, leading to an underdiagnosis and undertreatment of adult
ADHD. The significance of identifying and addressing ADHD is on the rise, given its
widespread recognition as a condition that hinders an individual's ability to interact
effectively with their environment, thereby elevating the potential for harmful events.

## Project Overview
The aim is to develop a text classification system for automatically identifying ADHD
symptoms in text responses. Followed by an integration of this system into a chatbot that runs
on Zenbo, a physical robot developed by Asus. The chatbot will facilitate real-time
interactions with users, providing a user-friendly interface for ADHD symptom assessment,
support, and information dissemination.
